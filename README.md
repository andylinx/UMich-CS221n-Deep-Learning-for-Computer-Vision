# UMich-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision

Homework for EECS 498.008 / 598.008 Deep Learning for Computer Vision.



### Cousre Introduction

Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image    understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these    applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification and object detection.    Recent developments in neural network approaches have greatly advanced the performance of    these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of    neural-network based deep learning methods for computer vision. During this course, students    will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed    understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. We will cover learning algorithms,    neural network architectures, and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning    networks for visual recognition tasks.


### Record

A2 SVM loss function has a fantastic implementation of matrix.

A2 softmax_loss: we should substract the max number to avoid numeric instability.
